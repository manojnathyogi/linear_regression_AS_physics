[1] What is grade threshold? 
    A grade threshold is the minimum number of marks that a candidate needs to obtain a particular grade in a paper or in a subject in a particular series (may/jun OR oct/nov).
    
[2] Percentage (%) of students achieving grade
    The percentage of students achieving grade is calculated and published by Cambridge Assessment International Education based on the total number of students appearing the subject in a particular series (may/jun OR oct/nov).

[3] The relation of percentage achieveing the grade (a, b, c, d, e) with the grade threshold for each grades (a, b, c, d, e) is checked and presented in the graphs (Linear Graph).
